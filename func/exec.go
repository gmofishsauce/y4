// The opcodes basically spread out to the right, using more and
// more leading 1-bits. The bits come in groups of 3, with the
// special case that 1110... is jlr and 1111... requires decoding
// the next three (XOP) bits. After that, 1111 111... requires
// decoding the next three bits, then 1111 111 111..., etc.
//
// This is implemented by several 8-element function tables where
// the last ("111") element in the table defer to the next table,
// etc. This is the equivalent of chaining 3-to-8 decoders in
// hardware where the "111" (7) output enables the next, then the
// next, etc. This is not really how you'd do it ("ripple" decode,
// too slow) but it's nice and simple here.
