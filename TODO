Place instruction set in a separate Google Doc. (Done.)

Make initial assignment of special registers and exception numbers. (Done.)

Renumber yops. Fix doc, asm, dis, add test in itf, and implement yops in func. (Done.)

Decide whether 0x0000 is permanently going to be an illegal opcode. (Done. Yes.)

Fix the disassembler to handle both kernel and user code. (Bypassed in the course of progress.)

Decide whether the disassembler should be callable from func. (2024-02-04: still open.)
	Or else maybe modify func to print instructions in better format,
	something like o3.b.o3.o3.o3.o3 for easier eyeball disassembly.

Fix func to make no output when -d is not given. (Done, although output is printed at halt time.)

Eventually, add -i for single step interactive and use -d for debugging. (TODO)
